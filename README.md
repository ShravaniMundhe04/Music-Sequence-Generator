# Music-Sequence-Generator
Generates music using LSTM networks and music21.

This project uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to generate music sequences.
- Built in Python using the `music21` library.
- Inspired by Google’s Sebastian Bach Doodle.
- Generates MIDI files from trained sequences of musical notes.
- Ideal for experimenting with AI-based music composition.

## How it works
1. Prepare a dataset of musical notes.
2. Train an LSTM model to learn note sequences.
3. Generate new music sequences using the trained model.
4. Save output as MIDI for playback.
